# Star Wars Character of the Day

This project is a frontend application built using Next.js. The application randomly selects and displays a Star Wars character each day from the Star Wars API (SWAPI).

Each user will see the same character for the entire day, but different users or browsers may see different characters.

## Requirements

- NodeJS: `22.8.0`

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
# If `nvm` is installed, run this command to get the correct node version
nvm use

# Start local server
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

Have fun ðŸ™‚!
